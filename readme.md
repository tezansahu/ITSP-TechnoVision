# <p align="center">ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USING FACE RECOGNITION</p>

### <p align="right">-Team TechnoVision</p>

For the Institute Technical Summer Project-2018, our team intended to build an Attendance Recording Bot that could use face recognition to mark the attendance of students while they are sitting for the lecture. We created an app for the students so that they get to check their attendance, which would be updated after the bot records their attendance. Another app, for the professor, to control the bot has also been developed by us.
Currently, this bot can work in classrooms where there are a small number of students.
